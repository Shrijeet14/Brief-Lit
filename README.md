## 👾 Features

|      | Feature         | Summary       |
| :--- | :---:           | :---          |
| ⚙️  | **Architecture**  | <ul><li>The project is structured around a Jupyter notebook (`Brief_Lit_updated.ipynb`) and a Python script (`helper_functions.py`).</li><li>The notebook likely contains the main code for processing and simplifying PubMed abstracts.</li><li>The Python script provides utility functions for image processing, model performance visualization, and data management.</li></ul> |
| 🔩 | **Code Quality**  | <ul><li>The code is organized into a notebook and a helper script, indicating a separation of concerns.</li><li>The helper script contains utility functions, suggesting that the code is modular and reusable.</li></ul> |
| 📄 | **Documentation** | <ul><li>The primary language of the project is Jupyter Notebook, which allows for inline documentation and explanations.</li><li>The project does not appear to have a dedicated documentation section, so the notebook likely contains the main documentation.</li></ul> |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**  | <ul><li>The project checks for the availability of a GPU, suggesting it may integrate with GPU-accelerated libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.</li></ul> |
| 🧩 | **Modularity**    | <ul><li>The project is divided into a notebook and a helper script, indicating a modular design.</li><li>The helper script contains utility functions, further demonstrating modularity.</li></ul> |
| 🧪 | **Testing**       | <ul><li>There are no explicit test commands provided, so the project may lack a formal testing framework.</li></ul> |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**   | <ul><li>The project checks for the availability of a GPU, suggesting it is designed for high-performance, computationally intensive tasks.</li></ul> |
